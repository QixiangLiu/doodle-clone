//person.js - Object that encapsulates a "person" for our purposes.
//          - Besides the obvious, perhaps it should contain a dynamically
//          - allocated array(that can change size during runtime) that houses
//          - n number of availabilities.  Perhaps those can be strings in a format
//          - such as "MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss -> MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss"

var person = {
    var firstName,
    var lastName,
