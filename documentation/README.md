# doodle-clone
A collaborative project to create a Doodle clone. Project was completed in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  Data storage was performed through localStorage. LocalStorage is an in-built html function that allows storage of any sort of data with a key. Project has four html pages including a landing page (welcome page with credits), a Create Event page that allows for creation of an event, a set availability page that allows a user to go in and set their availability for any particular event, and a documentation page. 

Final HTML pages are viewable in a browser. 
Project was done through JavaScript because developers believed it would be easily navigable. 

Doodle-clone was completed as a part of project 1 for EECS 448, Software Engineering I. Team 1 contributor's are listed on the home page of the web application.
