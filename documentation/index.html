    </div>
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <div class="textBody">Our doodle clone utilized mainly JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. To perform data storage, we used localStorage, a built in HTML function that takes in a key which stores any sort of information you want it to.
      We utilized this store the object-converted string of event objects. <div>
    <h2>Functions:</h2>
    <div class="textbody">
    <ul>
	       <li>getData(): Retrieves values from the form designed in eventMaker() and assigns those values to JavaScript variables.</li>
	       <li>addEvent(arrayOfSlots): Assigns values to the properties associated with eventInfo(). It also performs constraint checks on dates and duplicate meetings.
         Returns true if the date and time checks are passed. In this case, person and event counters are incremented and the event is
          added to events.arrayOfEvents. Otherwise, it returns false. </li>
         <li>checkDate(): Ensures that meetings are not created on January 1st, July 4th, and December 25th.</li>
         <li>dupMeet(): Checks if an event with the same name exists at creation.</li>
         <li>enteringEvent(): Calls getData() and addEvent(popTimeSlots)</li>
         <li>storeData(): Stringifies an object to a JSON string and stores it in localStorage.</li>
         <li>gettingDate(): Retrieves string data for a particular object from localStorage. This is done with the key value "objectString". Once this is done, the string is parsed and the object is assigned to a particular event in the
         array of events. </li>


    </ul>
