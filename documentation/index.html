      <h1>Doodle-Clone Documentation</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <div class="textBody">Our doodle clone utilized mainly JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. To perform data storage, we used localStorage, a built in HTML function to sort any type of information using a key. Data is then parsed back at retrieval
      and the resulting object is placed in an array containing all live events.
       <div>
    <h2>Method signatures and information:</h2>
    <div class="textBody">
    <ul>
	       <li>getData(): Retrieves values from the form designed in eventMaker() and assigns those values to JavaScript variables. </li>
         <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: Values must be retrieved from the form || POST-COND: Assigns values to new variables || RETURN: none <div><br>
	       <li>addEvent(arrayOfSlots): Assigns values to the properties associated with eventInfo(). It also performs constraint checks on dates and duplicate meetings.
         Returns true if the date and time checks are passed. In this case, person and event counters are incremented and the event is
          added to events.arrayOfEvents. Otherwise, it returns false. </li>
          <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: None || POST-COND: Writes values to eventInfo() || RETURN: True if all checks are passed; false if not.  <div><br>
         <li>checkDate(): Ensures that meetings are not created on January 1st, July 4th, and December 25th.</li>
         <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: None || POST-COND: Check is done that meeting is not created on certain dates || RETURN: True if date is valid; false otherwise. <div><br>
         <li>dupMeet(): Checks if an event with the same name exists at creation.</li>
         <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: None || POST-COND: Check is done whether an event with the same name exists || RETURN: False if the event has already been created; true otherwise. <div><br>
         <li>enteringEvent(): Calls getData() and addEvent(popTimeSlots)</li>
         <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: None || POST-COND: Creates a new event || RETURN: True if new event was created; false otherwise. <div><br>
         <li>storeData(): Stringifies an object to a JSON string and stores it in localStorage.</li>
         <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: Events object must be created || POST-COND: Stringifies object in JSON and writes it to localStorage || RETURN: none <div><br>
         <li>gettingData(): Retrieves string data for a particular object from localStorage. This is done with the key value "objectString". Once this is done, the string is parsed and the object is assigned to a particular event in the
         array of events. </li>
         <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: localStorage item cannot equal NULL || POST-COND: String is parsed and object is assigned to array || RETURN: none <div><br>
         <li>dropdownMenu(): Acts as an onclick action for the HTML dropdown menu.</li>
         <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: None || POST-COND: Shows or does not show the menu onclick || RETURN: none <div><br>
         <li>init(): Initializer function to create button events, as well as populate timeslots and HTML buttons. It calles in order, addButtonEvents(), populateTimeSlots(), and
         populateButtonHTML().</li>
         <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: Function is called when page loads || POST-COND: Initializing code to display buttons and populate them is run || RETURN: none <div><br>
         <li>addButtonEvents(): Defines event listeners for the buttons. </li>
         <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: None || POST-COND: Add selecting event to time slot buttons/toggles background color || RETURN: none <div><br>
         <li>populateTimeSlots(): Pushes timeslots into timeSlots array. </li>
         <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: None || POST-COND: For each button, populates time slot button ID || RETURN: none <div><br>
         <li>eventSubmit(): Determines which timeslots are selected and adds them to a selectedList of timeSlots. </li>
         <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: Only happens if time slots are selected (1 or more) || POST-COND: Adds time slots to the availability array || RETURN: none <div><br>
         <li>populateButtonHTML(): Adds correct time text to buttons. It accounts for 12 hour or 24 hour time mode.  </li>
         <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: None || POST-COND: Adjusts to either 12 or 24 hour time mode || RETURN: none <div><br>
         <li>toggleMode(): Switches twelveHourMode back and forth to the 24 hour time mode and correspondingly repopulates the time slot button text fields.  </li>
         <div class="textBody"> PRE-COND: Change Time Mode button must be pressed || POST-COND: Toggles time between 12 or 24 hour displays || RETURN: none <div><br>
    </ul>
